## Overview

The **Cloud Upload Plugin** allows you to seamlessly upload WordPress media files to Google Cloud Storage, eliminating the need for local storage. This plugin automatically uploads files to a specified Google Cloud Storage bucket, organizes them by year and month, and replaces the local file URLs with public URLs from Google Cloud. Additionally, when media files are deleted from the WordPress media library, they are also removed from Google Cloud Storage.

## Features

- Uploads media files to Google Cloud Storage.
- Organizes uploaded files in a `year/month` directory structure within the bucket.
- Replaces local file URLs with public URLs from Google Cloud Storage.
- Automatically deletes media files from Google Cloud Storage when removed from WordPress.

    - When you upload a file through the WordPress media library, it will automatically be uploaded to Google Cloud Storage.
    - The file will be stored in a year/month directory structure within your bucket.
    - The URL of the file in WordPress will be replaced with the public URL from Google Cloud Storage.

### Deleting Media Files

    - When you delete a media file from the WordPress media library, the plugin will automatically delete the corresponding file from Google Cloud Storage.

### Troubleshooting
